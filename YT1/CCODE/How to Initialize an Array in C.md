## Description 

In the video I show you how to initialize a one dimensional array in c. I will show you two methods. The first one, will initialize all the values of the array to zero. With the second one, you can initialize the array with the value you want. The code is written in the c language, using the Geany editor. It was tested on Ubuntu 18.04. In the second solution, functions and loops concepts were used to initialize the array.
