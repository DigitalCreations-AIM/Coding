## Description 

In this video I  show and explain an c code that insert a new element to an array. The code is written in c language. The elements of the array are of type int. The new value is inserted just after the last element of the array. 

Two solutions are proposed. The first one, just follows the logic of reasoning. The second one tends to enhance the previous solution.
The code is applied to a one dimensional array, and test on Ubuntu 18.04.
