[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nyDkq8F1Xcg/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/nyDkq8F1Xcg)

In the video I explain how to get the value of a selected item in a listbox widget, from the tkinter library. I wrote the code in python3. And I also used other elements from tkinter. So, in the example you will see how to use buttons and message-boxes as well. If you have any suggestions, please let me know in the comment below. Bye ðŸ™‚.
