In this video I show you how to create a red label using a ttk widget (python langage, tkinter library) . The problem with ttk widgets, is that you cannot directly set the foreground and the background colors of the widget. Neither when creating the widget, neither when calling configure. This is why you have to use Styles to customize the appearence of your widgets.
