## Description

  

In the video I show how to use the Tkinter  Frame widget in Python 3. I use 3 TK Frames to place 3 labels on the window using 3 different layout managers: pack, place, and grid.

A similar code is available on the website at this page https://www.aimosta.com/Blogt/blogt-4.html. I am planning to add the later actual code to Github.
